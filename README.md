# Siremar
Siremar website is part of my academic project which is built using React Js, HTML, CSS, PHP, Laravel, and Node JS.
Ideated and developed a fully responsive dynamic website using HTML, CSS, and React JS for front-end and Laravel for the backend for a Margarita Island which is known as SIREMAR website. 
Siremar website is developed to manage all the residents of Margarita island by registering all the residents online which will help the Central Government to keep track of the finances and population.
Used MySQL to store the data related to Residents, Inspectors, Events, all Business Activities in the Island, and designed Admin Panel for managing the content of the website including stock of Business.
Implemented Live chat using Node JS where all the Residents can reach out to the Siremar team for any queries.
All the Residents can easily avail offers on various Events and Business and book flights on the Website.
All the Residents activities are monitored and approved by Inspector and Admin.
Implemented Login and Sign-Up page with all kinds of validations. Users will also be notified through an Email when they book an Event or flight.
